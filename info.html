<h3>ConveX3D Earth</h3>
<p>
    ConveX3D Earth is an educational program whose goal is to spread
    geographical knowledge to anyone. It offers an alphabetical list of all
    countries in the world, whose locations can be pinpointed on a
    three-dimensional world map. In addition to that, further information
    regarding those countries can be retrieved.

<h4>Three-dimensional world map</h4>
<p>
    The rich and detailed three-dimensional world map can be used for browsing
    and exploring the topographical characteristics of the earth. On top of that
    country boundaries can be displayed, giving an insight view on the
    territorial proportions of the earth.
    </br></br>
    The navigation is done by using only the mouse. By grabbing the earth with
    the left mouse button while dragging it, a rotational movement can be
    achieved. Zooming in and out is possible using the mouse wheel.
    Alternatively the right mouse button can be held while moving the mouse up
    or down. Resetting the view to its original state can be achieved by pushing
    the button <i>Reset view</i>. In a similar fashion political country
    boundaries can be toggled by pushing the button <i>Country boundaries</i>.
